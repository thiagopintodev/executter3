Post-install message from capybara:
IMPORTANT! Some of the defaults have changed in Capybara 2.1. If you're experiencing failures,
please revert to the old behaviour by setting:

    Capybara.configure do |config|
      config.match = :one
      config.exact_options = true
      config.ignore_hidden_elements = true
      config.visible_text_only = true
    end

If you're migrating from Capybara 1.x, try:

    Capybara.configure do |config|
      config.match = :prefer_exact
      config.ignore_hidden_elements = false
    end

 = 1.9.1 : gem install rdoc-data; rdoc-data --install
>= 1.9.2 : nothing to do! Yay!
